'Git'ting Started
================
At Leigh Hackspace we're currently using a few things to keep track of things

[MeetUp][1]<br />
[GitHub][2]<br />
[GitHub Desktop][3]<br />
[Slack][4]<br />

please make an account on each of them (MeetUp,GitHub and Slack)
and send the email address(es) [preferably all one email address] to CodeClub[at]leighhack.org with your name so we know who you are...

but back to GitHub ... or more specifically [Git][5] <br />

 Git
---
[Git][5] is one of many version control systems out there - you may wonder _"why are we using Git instead of [insert other VCS here]>"_ mainly because using Git allows us to use
[GitHub][2] which is free for our purposes, one of the problems with that is that we can only use public repositories - although in our case its not _really_ a problem

so the first thing we need to do is create our [Github][2]

GitHub
----
GitHub https://github.com/ is an online source repository that uses Git as a source control system - it also has a nifty [Desktop app][3] which will make our lives easier for  source branching; creating pull requests; and such
